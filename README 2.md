# Crowdfunding_ETL

Mini Project by Barrett Fudge and Sergio Villa.

Instructions: For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

All dataframes have been cleaned according to project instructions and "Option 1" was utilized in the code.

NB: CREATE DATABASE crowdfunding_db; was used to create a new database in PostgreSQL to run the full crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file. Four CREATE TABLE commands and SELECT * FROM were used to import all data files into new tables with constraints noted, alters performed, and an ETL analysis set.
